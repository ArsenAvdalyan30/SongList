# My React Intern Project

Welcome to my React internship project! This project is a music application that allows users to manage and interact with their music playlist. Below, you'll find an overview of the project's components, structure, and styling.

## Components

### App

The `App` component serves as the main entry point for the application. It includes the `SongList`, `PlayAllButton`, `AddAllButton`, and `MusicUploadForm` components.

### SongList

The `SongList` component displays a table of songs using the `SongRow` component for each song entry.

### SongRow

The `SongRow` component represents a single row in the song list table. It displays song details and includes icons for various actions.

### PlayAllButton

The `PlayAllButton` component is a button that triggers the "Play All" action. It includes an arrow icon and a dropdown icon.

### AddAllButton

The `AddAllButton` component is a button that triggers the "Add All" action. It includes an arrow icon and a dropdown icon.

### MusicUploadForm

The `MusicUploadForm` component allows users to upload music files. It includes an input for file selection and a button for uploading.

## Styling

### App.module.css

Defines styles for the main application container.

### SongList.module.css

Contains styles for the `SongList` component, including table styles.

### SongRow.module.css
